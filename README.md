# Submodules Alternative

[![Submodules Alternative](https://socialify.git.ci/Panquesito7/submodules-alternative/image?description=1&descriptionEditable=Easy-to-use%20Git%20modules%20alternative&font=Source%20Code%20Pro&issues=1&language=1&name=1&owner=1&pattern=Circuit%20Board&stargazers=1&theme=Auto)](https://github.com/Panquesito7/submodules-alternative)

An easy-to-use Git (Sub)modules alternative to make the cloning process easier.\
**The project is still WIP and still contains bugs. It is recommended to use in small projects until the tool is fairly stable.**

## What's the difference?

- Cloning repositories is now super easier: anyone can clone your repository **without the need for Git**. No more `clone recursive` or `submodule update` commands!
- Submodule addition/update is automated by GitHub Actions (if desired), making it easier to integrate into your projects.
- Lightweight and documented codebase in [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) v5.3.3.
- Git Submodules can sometimes be messy or confusing, which this tool aims to solve.
- Lets you choose the desired branch of the repository, unlike Git Submodules which automatically chooses the default branch.
<!-- - Easily specify which files are ignored at the moment of updating the repositories. This is very useful if you want to modify a repository/submodule. -->

## Usage

1. Create a new file named `repos.lua` (or as you desire) with all your selected repositories ([template](https://github.com/Panquesito7/submodules-alternative/blob/main/repos-template.lua) file).

Your `repos.lua` file should look similar to the following.\
**It is recommended to not include `.git` at the end of URLs for various settings on the script.**

```lua
local repos = {
    {
        name = "opencv",
        url = "https://github.com/opencv/opencv",
        dir = "libs/",
        def_branch = "master"
    },
    {
        name = "texto",
        url = "https://github.com/realstealthninja/texto",
        dir = "libs/"
    },
}

-- Fully needed, so that the scripts can access the repositories.
return {
    repos = repos
}
```

### GitHub Actions

This GitHub Action workflow will automatically update or clone the desired repositories.\
You can choose to update, clone, or do both actions. You can also configure how the script works.

```yml
name: Submodules Alternative
on:
  schedule:
  #        ┌───────────── minute (0 - 59)
  #        │  ┌───────────── hour (0 - 23)
  #        │  │ ┌───────────── day of the month (1 - 31)
  #        │  │ │ ┌───────────── month (1 - 12 or JAN-DEC)
  #        │  │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of the week (0 - 6 or SUN-SAT)
  #        │  │ │ │ │
  #        │  │ │ │ │
  #        │  │ │ │ │
  #        *  * * * *
  - cron: '0 0 * * 1' # This would run weekly on Monday at 00:00 UTC
jobs:
  update-repos:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0 # This pulls changes before doing any changes
      - uses: Panquesito7/submodules-alternative@v1.5.5
        with:
          repos_filename: repos                       # In case your file is named `repos.lua`, you can leave it as `repos`.
          use_pr: true                                # Whether to create a pull request when updating/adding the repositories.
          branch_name: repo-update                    # The branch name to use (only if `use_pr` is enabled).
          commit_message: "Update"                    # Commit message used when adding new repositories.
          commit_message_update: "Bump repositories"  # Commit message used when updating all the repositories.
          add_repos: false                            # If enabled, this will clone all the repositories listed in your repos file.
          update_repos: true                          # When enabled, this will attempt to update all the repositories.
          squash_commits: false                       # Whether to squash all commits or not on every repository update/addition. Cannot be used if `one_pr` is disabled.
          one_pr: false                               # Creates one single PR for everything if enabled. Works only for `update_repos` if disabled.
          delete_existing_branches: true              # Deletes the branches that updated the subtrees. Note that this is done only on action run, not on immediate PR merge.
```

If `delete_existing_branches` is enabled, it will attempt to delete the branches before running the scripts to ensure there are no merge conflicts.\
However, this is not the most efficient way of deleting the branches. These are other alternatives I recommend:

1. Automatically [delete branches](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/managing-the-automatic-deletion-of-branches) on PR merging (recommended).
2. Manually delete the branches (not recommended).
3. Use a GitHub Action like [Delete Merged Branch](https://github.com/SvanBoxel/delete-merged-branch).

You can also configure to run the workflow manually by using `workflow_dispatch` instead of `schedule`.\
For more information about Cron, you can check [CronHub](https://crontab.cronhub.io/).

### Manually

1. Run `fetch-repos.lua` to clone all the repositories automatically.

> **Note**
>
> You will need to install Lua v5.3.3 in your\
> machine in case you do not have it installed.
>
> Download: <https://www.lua.org/download.html>
>
> **Both `fetch-repos.lua` and `update-repos.lua` require\
> `helper-functions.lua` for extra functions and safety checks.**

```bash
lua fetch-repos.lua <repos_filename> <squash_commits> <commit_message> # No filename format required!
```

2. Once done, you can push changes. Committing is already done by the script.

```bash
git push
```

3. Done! All of your repositories are now available in your project and can be updated later on. 🎉

If you've updated your repositories list, you can always run the script again and it'll clone the new repositories.

## Updating the repositories

By using GitHub Actions, the repositories will be updated automatically.\
If you wish to do that manually, you can run the following script.

**Remember to use `""` around the commit message!**

```bash
lua update-repos.lua <repos_filename> <commit_message> <squash_commits> # No filename format required!
```

After running the script, you can push changes to the desired branch.\
The script already takes care of committing everything.
