# Submodules Alternative

An easy-to-use Git (Sub)modules alternative to make the cloning process easier.

## What's the difference?

- Cloning repositories is now super easier: anyone can clone your repository **without the need for Git**. No more `clone recursive` or `submodule update` commands!
- Submodule addition/update is automated by GitHub Actions (if desired), making it easier to integrate into your projects.
- Lightweight and documented codebase in [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) v5.3.3.
- Git Submodules can sometimes be messy or confusing, which this tool aims to solve.
<!-- - Easily specify which files are ignored at the moment of updating the repositories. This is very useful if you want to modify a repository/submodule. -->

## Usage

1. Create a new file named `repos.lua` (or as you desire) with all your selected repositories ([template](https://github.com/Panquesito7/submodules-alternative/blob/main/repos-template.lua) file).

Your `repos.lua` file should look similar to the following.

```lua
local repos = {
    {
        name = "opencv",
        url = "https://github.com/opencv/opencv",
        dir = "libs/",
        def_branch = "master"
    },
    {
        name = "texto",
        url = "https://github.com/realstealthninja/texto",
        dir = "libs/"
    },
}

-- Fully needed, so that the scripts can access the repositories.
return {
    repos = repos
}
```

### GitHub Actions

This GitHub Action workflow will automatically update or clone the desired repositories.\
You can choose to update, clone, or do both actions.

```yml
name: Submodules Alternative
on:
  schedule:
  #        â”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ minute (0 - 59)
  #        â”‚  â”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ hour (0 - 23)
  #        â”‚  â”‚ â”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ day of the month (1 - 31)
  #        â”‚  â”‚ â”‚ â”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ month (1 - 12 or JAN-DEC)
  #        â”‚  â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ day of the week (0 - 6 or SUN-SAT)
  #        â”‚  â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”‚
  #        â”‚  â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”‚
  #        â”‚  â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”‚
  #        *  * * * *
  - cron: '0 0 * * 1' # This would run weekly on Monday at 00:00 UTC
jobs:
  update-repos:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0 # This pulls changes before doing any changes
      - uses: Panquesito7/submodules-alternative@v1.3.0
        with:
          repos_filename: repos    # In case your file is named `repos.lua`, you can leave it as `repos`.
          use_pr: true             # Whether to create a pull request when updating/adding the repositories.
          branch_name: repo-update # The branch name to use (only if `use_pr` is enabled).
          commit_message: "Update" # The commit message used when pushing (optional; basic message is used).
          add_repos: false         # If enabled, this will clone all the repositories listed in your repos file.
          update_repos: true       # When enabled, this will attempt to update all the repositories.
          squash_commits: false    # Whether to squash all commits or not (experimental). USE ONLY ON `use_pr` FOR SAFETY.
```

You can also configure to run the workflow manually by using `workflow_dispatch` instead of `schedule`.\
For more information about Cron, you can check [CronHub](https://crontab.cronhub.io/).

### Manually

1. Run `fetch-repos.lua` to clone all the repositories automatically.

> **Note**
>
> You will need to install Lua v5.3.3 in your\
> machine in case you do not have it installed.
>
> Download: <https://www.lua.org/download.html>
>
> **Both `fetch-repos.lua` and `update-repos.lua` require\
> `check-variables.lua` to make sure everything is set properly.**

```bash
lua fetch-repos.lua <repos_filename> # No filename format required!
```

2. Once done, you can push changes. Committing is already done by the script.

```bash
git push
```

3. Done! All of your repositories are now available in your project and can be updated later on. ðŸŽ‰

If you've updated your repositories list, you can always run the script again and it'll clone the new repositories.

## Updating the repositories

By using GitHub Actions, the repositories will be updated automatically.\
If you wish to do that manually, you can run the following script.

```bash
lua update-repos.lua <repos_filename> # No filename format required!
```

## To-do

- If the squash commits option is enabled, a new repository is added, and the workflow is run again, the commits should be squashed using `force-with-lease`.
- Make sure all the options and everything work perfectly fine.
- Clean up the action code to work faster and better.
- Create a PR per repository update, just like Dependabot does.
